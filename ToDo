Allow classes to output to a single log.
Create logging class for all classes to use


Scheduler separates songs by some distance of time.
Meaning x minutes from the end of one song to the
beginning of the next.
Has to added effect of randomizing the start times
of the next song a bit
This should probably be used for all audio files

If scheduler is going to handle playing all audio files
it might start getting complex.
Just keep that in mind as things progress.

Should a songQ (or any queue) be reshuffled after
we've gone through all songs?
