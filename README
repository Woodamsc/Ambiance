Hey.

Ambiance is a small personal project I decided to start a 
few months back after visiting back home.
I noticed my parents house had an added sense of serenity...
I really couldn't quite place what was different, and I 
didn't question it too hard, but I knew something was up.

Finally our grandfather clock start chiming that it was 
six O'clock and two things instantly clicked.
	
	1) There was soft, familiar music playing the whole time
	2) We definitely didn't, and don't, have a grandfather clock

I asked my mother and found out she leaves Animal Crossing
for the Wii playing in background because 'She likes the music.'

So that's essentially the inspiration, and goal, of this project.
Creating a sense of Ambiance the user can choose.
Have any type of music or other audio you choose to be played
in a way that's gently dips in and out of your day.

This is my first project on my own, and I have a bit of a personal
thing for it, so I'm not sure if I'll accept much outside help. 
I'd kinda like to have the experience of making something on my
own, to get that experience of frustration and satisfaction.

But feel absolutely free to re-use what I've got for your own 
needs, place some suggestions/feature requests, or just send
me a message saying 'hey'
